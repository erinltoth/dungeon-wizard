# Dungeon Wizard
Dungeon Wizard is a single-page app that allows users to create an account, browse through a list of Dungeons & Dragons campaigns that are looking for members, and request to join one that interests them. They can filter the list of campaigns based on a number of playing style and experience level options. In response, Dungeon Masters (those who create and manage the campaigns) can create campaigns, approve or reject join requests, and update their campaign page with the next play session date that only their approved players can see. 
Dungeon Wizard is a React/Rails application. This repository is the React front-end; in order to see the entire project please [check out the Rails back-end repository](https://github.com/pnolan89/dungeon-wizard-api).
